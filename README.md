This package provides a way of drawing a table using ggplot2, using `geom_text`, only.
The main purpose is to make tables easy to align using e.g. patchwork or cowplot and use them as axis labels.
I want to keep styling options to a minimum (i.e. aesthetics available to `geom_text`).

## Installation

You can install the released version of simplePlotTable from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("simplePlotTable")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(simplePlotTable)
## basic example code
```
